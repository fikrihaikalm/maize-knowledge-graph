There are no known chemical treatments at the moment.',\n",

The grubs develop in organic matter in the soil, and some infest roots, but without causing serious damage to the crop. The adults measure 7 – 15 mm in length and 5 – 7 mm in breadth. The two sexes are alike. The body is compact and oval, usually somewhat flattened, brilliantly coloured and mostly brick red with black and white markings.',\n",

The first sign is usually the discoloration and thickening of young leaves. Yellowing may be uniform, or diffusely interveinal, fading gradually with distance from the main veins. Leaves and stems near the shoot tip are brittle and break easily when bent. Leaves may become puckered (slightly raised in interveinal zones) and the tip and lateral lobes may curl down. In some cases, the leaf veins may appear thickened and raised and petioles may twist. Internodes may be shortened, producing a higher density of leaves near the apex. At greater severity, the deficiency causes necrosis of the growing points. Storage roots are often short and blunt-ended and may split as the deficiency progresses.",

Further recommendations:",

Soils with low organic matter content (<1.5%) or sandy soils (prone to nutrient leaching) are also susceptible to boron deficiency. The application of boron may not correct the deficiency in those cases because it may remain unavailable for plant absorption. Symptoms on foliage might resemble those of other pathologies: false spider mite, zinc deficiency or mild iron deficiency. On storage roots, blister-like bumps and cracking can also be symptoms of root-knot nematode or rapid changes in soil moisture. Calcium deficiency may also result in the death of shoot and root tips, but young leaves below the shoot tip are not thickened and do not develop interveinal yellowing.",

Once present, it is transmitted persistently to healthy maize plants by the feeding of the insects mentioned above. It can also overwinter in their larval stages when maize plants are not at hand. It is not thought to be seedborne. However transmission through mechanical wounds is possible. High temperature, plant stress and long periods of wet weather favor the development of the disease.",
