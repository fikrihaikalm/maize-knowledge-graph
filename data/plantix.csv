There are no known chemical treatments at the moment.","Damage is caused by the chafer adults. Flower chafers are day-flying beetles and mainly pollen feeders. The grubs develop in organic matter in the soil, and some infest roots, but without causing serious damage to the crop. The adults measure 7 – 15 mm in length and 5 – 7 mm in breadth. The two sexes are alike. The body is compact and oval, usually somewhat flattened, brilliantly coloured and mostly brick red with black and white markings.","The beetle migrates between crops and has a wide host range. Changing crop patterns and continuous use of insecticides may change the pest from minor pest to major pest status. Careful monitoring and timely reporting on this chafer beetle are necessary to avoid any future outbreak. In eggplant, the periodical application of insecticides for the management of shoot and fruit borer keeps the beetle population under control."

The first sign is usually the discoloration and thickening of young leaves. Yellowing may be uniform, or diffusely interveinal, fading gradually with distance from the main veins. Leaves and stems near the shoot tip are brittle and break easily when bent. Leaves may become puckered (slightly raised in interveinal zones) and the tip and lateral lobes may curl down. In some cases, the leaf veins may appear thickened and raised and petioles may twist. Internodes may be shortened, producing a higher density of leaves near the apex. At greater severity, the deficiency causes necrosis of the growing points. Storage roots are often short and blunt-ended and may split as the deficiency progresses.","Make sure to have healthy soils with good organic matter content and a good water retention capacity by applying farm manure. Use fertilizers containing boron (B).
Example: disodium octaborate tetrahydrate (Boron 20%) for foliar spray.
Consult your agricultural advisor to know the best product and dosage for your soil and crop.
Further recommendations:
It is recommended to do a soil test before the start of the cropping season to optimize your crop production.
It is better to apply boron to the soil because foliar sprays can damage leaves on many crops. Further recommendations:","Boron deficiency is usually observed in soils with a high pH because in these conditions this element is in a chemical form that is not available for the plant. Soils with low organic matter content (<1.5%) or sandy soils (prone to nutrient leaching) are also susceptible to boron deficiency. The application of boron may not correct the deficiency in those cases because it may remain unavailable for plant absorption. Symptoms on foliage might resemble those of other pathologies: false spider mite, zinc deficiency or mild iron deficiency. On storage roots, blister-like bumps and cracking can also be symptoms of root-knot nematode or rapid changes in soil moisture. Calcium deficiency may also result in the death of shoot and root tips, but young leaves below the shoot tip are not thickened and do not develop interveinal yellowing.","Avoid soils with a high pH and are rich in clay minerals, iron or aluminum oxides. Avoid high air humidity and low soil moisture. Do not over-fertilize or lime the soils. Avoid over-watering of the crops. Have the soil tested regularly to gain a thorough understanding of the nutrient levels of your field."

The disease is characterized by the presence of numerous, minute yellow specks and streaks that run parallel to the veins on leaves. As they grow and coalesce, they produce long stripes, bands or blotches of chlorotic tissue, finally resulting in the death of the leaf. Plant have a stunted appearance, with short internodes. Male inflorescences are deformed, with short rachis and few spikelets. In particularly susceptible plants or in case of early infection, ears do not develop properly and there are fewer of them per plant.","There is no direct control of diseases caused by viruses.

However, the insect vectors that carry the virus may be managed with insecticides.","The symptoms are caused by a virus (MCMV) that can be transmitted by several types of insects: leafhoppers, beetles and also probably some species of mites (Tetranychus spp.) and thrips (Frankliniella spp.). MCMV is generally introduced into new maize-growing regions via infected plant material. Once present, it is transmitted persistently to healthy maize plants by the feeding of the insects mentioned above. It can also overwinter in their larval stages when maize plants are not at hand. It is not thought to be seedborne. However transmission through mechanical wounds is possible. High temperature, plant stress and long periods of wet weather favor the development of the disease.","Plant resistant varieties, if available, as it is the most important step against this disease. Monitor fields regularly and remove any infected plants. Avoid mechanical damages to the maize plants during field work. Control alternate weed hosts, especially grassy weeds. Plow field after the harvest to incorporate crop residues into the soil. Plan a crop rotation with a non-susceptible crop for one year."

Feeding by the adult leaves white scars on both sides of the leaves. Thinner leaves may develop papery, whitish patches. Infected plants show signs of wilting, yellowing, and drying of the leaves. The growing points of the plant can die, and young plants may succumb to the attack, resulting in death. The damage can also affect harvested crops. These crops can grow small, unmarketable heads or no heads at all (referred to as ""blind"" plants). Both adult bugs and nymphs extract sap from all plant parts. The adults also release a sticky substance that spoils the crop.","Several insects can parasitise the eggs of Bagrada hilaris, like Gryon, Ooencyyrtus, Telenomus and Trissolcus. The adult bugs are parasitised by flies and spiders. Soap solution sprays have also been found effective against the pest. Mix chilli, soap, garlic and paraffin and spray it on your crops.

The adult insect is black and has white and orange markings on its body, which is shaped like a shield. It measures about 5-7 millimeters. The insects lay their eggs in groups on leaves or in the soil near the plants. Initially, the young insects have no wings and are bright orange. As they grow, they turn red and develop dark markings until they look like the adult form. The insects mainly affect plants from the Brassica family, such as cabbage, cauliflower, and kale. These plants often suffer from heat and lack of water. The bugs harm the plants by sucking the sap from the leaves and infesting them in large numbers.","Before planting monitor your field and surrounding areas for this pest. After planting continue the monitoring during the warm parts of the day regularly. Only plant clean, non-infested transplants. Protective covers like a fine net material can be used to protect the seedlings. Remove crop residues and weeds from your field and destroy them."

The damage is caused by group C herbicides, such as atrazine, bromoxynil, diuron, and fluometuron. Due to their rapid and harmful effect on leaves, they are often qualified as 'bleachers'. They block photosynthesis and destroy the green pigments contained in the cells, discolouring them. Older leaves are more affected than younger leaves. Symptoms develop most rapidly in full sunlight. Problems with development of resistance are common in several types of weeds (grasses, mustard, stinging nettle and wild radish, for example).","Be sure to know the type of weed you are dealing with (basically broadleaf weeds or grasses). Carefully select the herbicide that best fits your purpose. Read the label carefully and follow dosage instructions, as indicated. Always clean the spray container after use to avoid contamination with a different herbicide. Avoid spraying in windy conditions to prevent drift to other fields. Use drift reducing spray nozzles that target weeds better. Try and test the herbicide in pastures and hayfields to monitor results. Check weather forecast carefully and do not spray while rain or direct exposure to sunlight.

7,https://plantix.net/en/library/plant-diseases/600030/spotted-stemborer/,Spotted Stemborer,Chilo partellus,Insect,"Young caterpillars of spotted stem borer feed on tender tissues of the plants. They bore tunnels into the leaves and whorls, leaving irregular scars, holes and windows. The older larvae tunnel the stems and feed on the internal tissues, hindering the transport of water and nutrients. This feeding activity leads to the so-called 'dead heart' symptom where the stem is hollow and only caterpillars and their frass can be observed inside. The upper part of the plants dries up partly or entirely. Early attacked plants are stunted in growth and may lodge. Older caterpillars also tunnel extensively in cobs. Overall, the feeding activity increases the incidence and severity of fungal or bacterial diseases.","Preparations based on Bacillus thuringiensis, neem oil extracts or Beauvaria bassiana have been used to control the pest. Plants such as molasses grass (Melinis minutiflora) or greenleaf desmodium (Desmodium intortum) produce volatile agents that repel the moths. Parasitoid wasps Cotesia sesamiae, C. flavipes and Trichogramma chilonis lay eggs into the larvae of spotted stemborer. Another wasp, Xanthopimpla stemmator, attacks the pest when it is in the pupal stage. Natural predators include earwigs and ants. They provide effective population control. Always consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments. Pesticides treatments should be weighted against the potential yield loss and the damage to the biodiversity of the area.

The forewings are light brown with some darker patterns while the hindwings are white. Adults are active at night and rest on plants and plant debris during the day. Females lay creamy white eggs in batches of 10-80 eggs onto the surface of the leaf. Caterpillars have a reddish-brown head and a light brown body with darker stripes running longitudinally and dark spots along the back, hence the name. The range of host plants is wide and includes sorghum, millet and maize. Climate conditions significantly impact the moths' life cycle. Warm and relatively humid conditions are particularly favorable. The pest most commonly occurs in hot lowland areas, and seldom above altitudes of 1500 m.","Grow tolerant plants, if available locally. Monitor the field regularly to spot feeding damage. Intercrop with legumes, or cowpea and molasses grass (Melinis minutiflora) to repel the spotted stem borer caterpillars. Maintain an optimum plant density to deter the insect. Sow 2-3 rows of trap crops on all sides. Use plant or pheromone traps around the field. Remove plants with signs of infection early. Check for volunteer plants and alternative hosts and remove them. Plant either earlier or later to avoid peak populations of the insect and peak feeding activity. Ensure good fertilization to get vigorous plants but avoid excessive use of nitrogen that increases pest attack. Implement wide crop rotation with non-host plants (for example cassava).

Larvae feed on root hairs, roots and stems, reducing the ability of the plant to absorb water and nutrients from the soil. Root tips may be chewed back to the base of the plant or appear brown and bored with tunnels. Symptoms show as drought or nutrient deficiencies. At later stages of plant growth, the damage to the root can weaken the stalk and lead to harvesting difficulties due to plant lodging. Damage by larvae also favors opportunistic pathogens. Moreover, some species of Diabrotica are vectors for the maize chlorotic mottle virus and the bacteria that cause bacterial wilt. This can lead to more yield losses.","Several species of nematodes, predators (mites, insects) and parasitoids flies and wasps can be used to control the population. For example, the tachinid fly Celatoria diabroticae can be introduced when the population of the cucumber beetle is not that large.

Cucumber beetles are usually yellow-green colored and are divided in two groups depending on their aspects. The first group have three black stripes down the back, while the second one is characterized by twelve black spots on the back. The adults overwinter in surrounding areas and become active in mid-spring, when temperatures begin to rise. Females deposit eggs in clusters in soil cracks near their host plants. The larvae feed in and on the roots first, later also on the shoot while adults feed on foliage, pollen and flowers. The development from egg to adult takes about a month, depending on environmental conditions. As temperatures increase, development time decreases. Cucumber beetles like moist areas with good water supply and dislike heat.","Delayed planting can avoid worst damage. Avoid planting your crop next to alternative host plants like melons, pumpkins or beans. Use mulch to cover soils and break the life cycle of the beetle.

It is characterized by the yellowing (chlorosis) of upper leaves, with the midrib and leaf veins remaining clearly green (interveinal chlorosis). At later stages, if no measures are taken, the whole leaf turns whitish-yellow and brown necrotic spots start to appear on the leaf blade, often leading to the development of necrotic patches on the margins. Affected areas can easily be identified from a distance in the field. Plants with iron deficiency are stunted in growth and potentially produce lower yields.","Smallholders may use a leaf fertiliser made of nettle slag and algae extract. Application of animal manure, peat and composts also add iron to the soil. Plant dandelions in the proximity of your crops, since they make iron available to nearby crops, especially trees. Use fertilisers containing iron (e.g. Ferrous sulphate Fe 19%).
Consult your agricultural advisor to know the best product and dosage for your soil and crop.
It is recommended to do a soil test before the start of the cropping season to optimise your crop production.","Iron deficiency can be a serious problem in leached tropical soils or in poorly drained soils, mostly under cool, damp springs. Sorghum, corn, potatoes, and beans are the most severely affected crops whereas wheat and alfalfa are the least sensitive. Calcareous, alkaline soils (pH 7.5 or higher) derived from limestone make plants especially prone to iron deficiency. Iron is important for photosynthesis and for the development and maintenance of root nodules in legumes. Therefore, iron deficiency severely depresses nodule mass, nitrogen fixation, and crop yield. The estimated critical level is around 2.5 mg/kg of plant dry tissue. The deficiency of iron also increases the uptake and accumulation of cadmium in plants.","Choose varieties that are less-susceptible to iron deficiency. Plant dandelion nearby cultivated plants. Fertilisers that contain iron as trace elements are recommended. If possible, avoid planting susceptible crops in calcareous, alkaline soil. Improve the drainage of the soils and do not over-water.

The mold grows on honeydew, a sticky, sugary secretion that is produced by some insects to attract fellow bugs. Using the honeydew as a food source, the mold gradually covers the surface of the affected plant part, coloring it in various shades of black. Sooty molds are non-parasitic and non-pathogenic fungi, so they do not colonize plant tissues or trigger symptoms. However, they alter the ability of the plant to perform photosynthesis and to exchange gases with the atmosphere. Severely infected leaves may die and fall off, thereby affecting the plants growth and survival.","Use formulations of neem oil, which is an organic broad spectrum compound, to ward off whiteflies, aphids, scales, ants, and mealy bugs. Neem oil also reduces the growth of the fungus itself. Insecticidal soap or dish soap (e.g. one tablespoon per 5 liters of water) can be sprayed on affected plants. After letting the soap solution settle on the plants, it can be rinsed off, thereby removing the mold. Always consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Synthetic insecticides of the organophosphate family can be used to prevent insects from feeding on the plant. Always consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Synthetic insecticides of the organophosphate family can be used to prevent insects from feeding on the plant.","Phloem-feeding insects like the mango leafhopper (Amritodus atkinsoni), whiteflies, aphids and many others are associated with the disease as they feed on plant sap. In the process of feeding, honeydew is secreted on the surface of the plant, thereby creating the perfect medium for sooty mold to grow on. Honeydew can drip down on neighboring leaves or plants, thus spreading the fungus further. The fungi survive as mold or as spores on plant parts, tools or transport vehicles. Insects also spread the mold from plant to plant. Ants, for example, tend to protect the sooty mold colonies for their own benefit.",Make sure to provide enough distance between the plants or trees and sufficient sunlight. Build physical barriers around trees or plants to prevent ants and plant sap-sucking insects from reaching them. Fertilize and water the trees sufficiently to ensure an optimal natural resistance of the trees to phloem-feeding parasites.

Typically, the adult moths are attracted to damaged and stressed plants. Feeding damage is only due to the larvae, which normally feed on rotting plant material. Having eaten up the residues, they start to feed on the healthy plant material (roots, stems, pseudostems, stalks and fruits). Seeds can be attacked, too. Initial symptoms appear as tunnels, but it is very difficult to spot them in the early stages. Most commonly, the pest is detected at later stages. The fleshy plant parts can be entirely hollowed out and leaves appear wilted. In adverse conditions this might result in defoliation and collapse of the plant.","In greenhouse experiments, the use of nematodes such as Steinernema feltiae, Heterorhabditis bacterophora and Heterorhabditis heliothidis was effective against the larvae.

They have a bright brown body, are about 11 mm in size and have a wing span of 18-25 mm. Forewings are of an homogeneous brown, with sometimes a long darker banding and males have a dark brown spot on them. The back wings are gray and brighter, with fringes in the margins. The female moth lays around 50-200 eggs in groups of about 5 into wounds and cracks of the plant tissue. After about 12 days the white or pale green, slightly transparent larvae hatch. The larvae have a bright reddish to brown head with an eye-like mark on both sides. The larvae grow to about 26 mm within about 50 days. Then they pupate at the end of the feeding tunnels. After an additional 20 days, the new generation of adult moths hatch. The development is strongly favored in cool temperatures (about 15°C) and dry weather. This period may be reduced under warmer weather conditions.",Use healthy seeds and planting material. Regularly check your plants or fields for any sign of the pest. Handpick and destroy infected plants or plant parts to curb the infestation. Remove and destroy dried out plant material as it can be a source of infestation.

This is followed by the reddening of older leaves, starting from the tip and later extending to the rest of the tissue. Some 2-4 days after the appearance of these symptoms, small chlorotic spots appear at the base of young developing leaves. As they grow, these spots coalesce and turn into stripes that run along the veins, often up to the tip. Plants infected at early stages are severely stunted, with twisted and distorted leaves and very short internodes. Multiple ear shoots and new tillers may develop, sometimes as many as 6-7 on a single plant, giving it a bushy appearance. Ears are smaller than usual and do not fill properly, often with loose grains.","There is no direct biological treatment to control S. kunkelii. Some bioinsecticides containing parasitic fungi species such as Metarhizium anisopliae, Beauveria bassiana, Paecilomyces fumosoroseus and Verticillium lecanii can be used to control acute infestation of planthoppers.

They are caused by Spiroplasma kunkelii, a bacterial-like organism that only infects maize plants. A number of leafhoppers, e.g. Dalbulus maidis, D. eliminatus, Exitianus exitiosus, Graminella nigrifons and Stirellus bicolor may carry this pathogen during their overwintering period. When they emerge in early spring, they start to feed on plants and transmit the pathogen. Disease symptoms usually appear about 3 weeks after the maize plant is first infected. Not surprisingly, the disease is most severe during the summer season, when leafhopper populations are very high. However, it can also occur in maize planted in spring.",Plant early to avoid peak populations of leafhoppers. Remove volunteer plants during the off-season. Use reflective plastic mulch to repel the adult leafhoppers. Control insecticide use as this can affect beneficial insects. Maintain a corn-free period over the winter months. Plan a crop rotation with non-susceptible crops (this will break the life cycle of the insect).

They damage roots, shown first in the upper parts of the plant as wilting. To confirm the presence of termites, it is necessary to pull out the affected plants and examine the roots and lower stem for live insects or the presence of tunnels. Plant roots and stems may be completely hollowed out and filled with soil waste. Some plants lodge during strong wind and they are often covered with soil, under which termites may be found. It is important to examine plants in the early morning or late evening, as termites may have moved deeper into the soil during the day when temperatures are higher.","Preparations based on nematodes that attack termites are effective against this pest. Solutions containing the fungi Beauveria bassiana or some species of Metarhizium are effective when applied into the termite hill. Fungi spores can also act as repellents. Neem seed kernel extracts (NSKE) have been used against termites on trees and on field crops with good results.

Their nests are sometimes very elaborate. Some build nests on moist dead tree stumps, while others build subterranean nests. They feed away from the nest protected through underground tunnels, on plant roots and other material in fields. Termites may attack plants if there is no other food available, therefore ensure there is plenty of soil organic matter. The reproductive termites are winged. Numerous winged males and females, generally dark in color and with well-developed eyes, are produced for swarming. Swarming is often taking place at dusk after the onset of heavy rains. After flying, they shed off their wings, mate, and burrow into holes in the soil and cracks in wood to create a new colony.","When planting, avoid bare, dry soils with little residues and organic content. Inspect plants regularly, early in the morning or late in the afternoon. Remove and destroy affected plants or plant parts. Promote conditions for healthy plant growth. Avoid water stress and unnecessary injury to the plants. Harvest early if possible, as termites often attack the crops left over in the field after maturity. Remove plant residues and other debris after harvest. Plow fields to destroy termites' nests and tunnels and to expose them to predators, such as ants, birds, chickens, etc. Practice crop rotations or grow in fields with intercrops."

Their predisposition to injuries and their growth potential makes them prone to show the most dramatic symptoms. Plants in the seedling stage are the most susceptible to infection. In that case, plant growth is stunted and they may not produce inflorescences or ears. On older plants, the infection results in the formation of tumorous growth, a combination of host and fungal tissues. Smut galls are greenish white at their early stages and turn black as they mature. They are particularly characteristic on ears, where each single kernel can develop its own gall.

These small gray-colored flies are polyphagous and attack main crops such as wheat, maize and sorghum. Other plants, such as peppers, beans or lentils, can also be affected. Females lay eggs singly, or more rarely in pairs, on the stems or on the soil near the base of the seedlings (the 3-4-leaf stage is preferred). The application of farmyard manure to the soil seems to attract more female flies and increase ovoposition. Newly emerged larvae are cylindrical and white.

As the deficiency progresses, these leaves eventually turn yellowish-white (veins included) and may curl or grow deformed. Young leaves remain pale green but grow much smaller than usual. Plants have a long, thin appearance due to the reduced branching but their height is usually normal. Plants become more susceptible to water stress and the wilting of leaves is common. Premature death and shedding may happen, which results in considerably lowered yields. Recovery becomes evident after a few days with the application of nitrogen fertilizer.","High levels of organic matter in soils can enhance soil structure and improve the capacity of the soil to retain water and nutrients. Organic matter can be added to soils as manure, compost, peat, or simply with the addition of nettle slag, guano, horn meal or nitrolime. Nettle slag can be sprayed directly on the leaves. Use fertilizers containing nitrogen (N).
Examples: Urea, NPK, ammonium nitrate.
Consult your agricultural advisor to know the best product and dosage for your soil and crop.
Further recommendations:
It is recommended to do a soil test before the start of the cropping season to optimize your crop production.
Best to apply nitrogen in multiple splits throughout the season.
Do not apply if you are close to harvesting time. Further recommendations:","High rates of nitrogen are important during the vegetative growth of the plant. In periods of favorable weather, it is important to provide the fast-growing crops with a good nitrogen supply, so that they can reach their maximum vegetative and fruit/grain production potential. Nitrogen deficiencies can be observed in sandy, well-drained soils with little organic matter as they are prone to the leaching of nutrients. Frequent rainfalls, flooding or heavy irrigation wash down nitrogen into the soil and can also lead to deficiencies. Periods of drought stress hinder the absorption of water and nutrients, resulting in an unbalanced nutrient supply. Finally, the soil pH also plays a role in the availability of nitrogen to the plant. Both low or high soil pH negatively affect the absorption of nitrogen by the plant.","Check the pH of the soil and lime to get the optimal range before the start of the cropping season to optimize your crop production. Provide fields with good drainage and do not over-water. Excessive or unbalanced use of fertilizers may result in some micronutrients becoming unavailable to the plant. Make sure to water plants regularly during periods of drought. Make sure to add organic matter from compost, manure or mulch for example.

Larger larvae leave a characteristic row of perforations and ragged margins on leaves, as well as lines of larval frass. They can also cut the base of the plant or attack the reproductive and young fruit. In the case of heavy infestation, fall armyworm larvae can cause extensive loss of leaves.","Wasp parasitoids include Cotesia marginiventris, Chelonus texanus and C. remus. The most common parasitoid fly is Archytas marmoratus. Predators include ground beetles, spined soldier bugs, flower bugs, birds or rodents.

Adult beetles are slightly elongated, and have yellow wing covers with black spots. They are mainly herbivorous and feed on silk, pollen or grains from crops such as maize, rice, sorghum or sunflower. They usually do not cause much damage to these plants. When there are too few crops in the field, the beetles gather gregariously in grasses and can be a problem if they are ingested by cattle, with a possibility of causing deaths. Females lay the eggs under dry leaves. Larvae live in the ground and feed on decaying plant debris. They can also sometimes cause damage to seeds or germinating maize seedlings, thus reducing plant stand. Periods of warm, dry weather (above 15°C) favors their life cycle.",Avoid monocrop systems as this favors the development of the pest.

The pathogen spores are dispersed by wind and rain and enter the maize ears through wounds. Plants are affected from seed germination on towards tassle emergence but symptoms are visible at later stages. It survives on seeds, crop residues or on alternative hosts such as grasses. It Spreads via spore infection through silks, roots and stalks. It enters the corn ears primarily through wounds from feeding damage from insects. It germinates and gradually colonizes the kernels from the entry points. Alternatively, it can start to colonize the plant from the roots and move up the plant through systemic growth. Plants can get infected under a wide range of environmental (stress) conditions, but the symptoms become particularly severe when the weather is warm (26-28°C) and moist and the plants have reached the flowering stage.","Plant disease free seeds and tolerant varieties such as SC 637. Ensure healthy and strong stalk development by minimizing overall stress in maize plants. Limit plant populations to 28,000 to 32,000 plants per acre in fields with known history of stalk rot with 70-90 cm inter-row spacing and 30-50 cm between plants. Practice careful irrigation, weed control and mantain adequate soil nutrient levels. Monitor plants carefully and watch out for white streaks in the grain surface, yellowing of young leaves and wilting symptoms at flowering stage and reddish browning of infected stalk at advanced stage. Keep stalkborers at a low level as they disperse the pathogen. Ensure good fertilization during later stages of plant growth. Remove infected plants and bury them. Till the soil to bury infected crop debris. Clean storage facilities thoroughly. Before stroring the grainheat the kernels until the moisture content is at or below 15%. Store grains at low humidities and low temperatures. Plan crop rotation after three years with legumes e.g. beans or soybean."

First symptoms usually appear in late stages of plant growth, either during the emergence of silk threads or at full maturity. Elongated to oval or circular light-brown lesions appear on the lower leaves, often surrounded by a dark margin. The length and width of the lesions depend on the strength of the pathogen and the type of plant used. In some cases, these lesions may also occur on leaf sheaths and husks covering the ear. Black mold is sometimes visible on the kernels.","Most treatments named here have only been used in small scales. Essential oil from Indian bael (Aegle marmelos) is active against Helminthosporium carbonum, at least in laboratory tests. Different compounds isolated from leaf extracts of some maize varieties (resistant and susceptible alike) can be toxic to the fungus. Fungi isolated from the pith of stalk rot-affected maize plants seem also to parasitize on known plant pathogenic fungi, including C. carbonum.

The spores on these debris serve as primary source of infection during wet weather. Secondary infection from plant to plant is wind- or rain-driven. The disease develops mainly on plants used in seed production and is therefore rarely a problem in the fields, where mostly resistant hybrids are grown. The progression of the disease is favored by moderate temperatures, humid weather, and minimal tillage of the field after harvest. If it occurs during the the grain filling phase, it can result in yield losses of 30 percent of more.","Check for tolerant or resistant varieties available in your market. Fields should be scouted on a weekly basis to monitor disease development. Space plants to allow canopy to dry quickly after rainfall or irrigation. Lay mulch on the soil to keep plants from touching the soil. Manage weeds to improve airflow and reduce humidity in canopy. Make sure to fertilize the crops suitably in terms of nitrogen and potassium contents. Avoid to work in fields when plants are wet.

Younger generation are smaller than adults but look alike to the adults. When the winter is warm, more of these bugs survive. So, in years with warm winters, you might see more of them.","Remove all grassy weeds from your rice field and nearby areas as they can provide shelter for these bugs. Once the rice grains are starting to form, start with biweekly checks in your field to spot the bug. Adults often fly out of the way before you reach the rice plant to check, so counts may only reveal the younger insects. For this reason check in the early morning where it is colder and adults move slower. While checking you can handpick and crush the bugs or brush them off with soapy water to prevent the population from growing.

It also has a variety of alternate hosts, such as corn, sorghum, and grasses. The larvae feed on the upper epidermis of the leaves and cause the main damage of the entire life cycle. Their feeding habit is characterized by the removal of the leaf tissues down to the lower cuticle, leaving thin, long, white scars or streaks that can be numerous in case of infestation. However, the adult beetles usually migrate to other plants or fields as they feed, meaning that severe damage to a single field is rare. From the distance, an affected field may look weathered and old, but usually damage does not exceed 40% of the total area. The beetle can be a significant and perennial crop pest in some cereal-growing regions.","Some species of nematodes of the genus Steinernema have been shown to attack the adults that overwinter in the soil, preventing them from reproducing in the spring. However, their efficiency can vary depending on the temperature. Some ladybugs also predate on eggs and larvae. The tachinid fly Hyalomyodes triangulifer parasitizes adults and is commercially available to control populations of O. melanopus. Larvae, in turn, can be controlled by the parasitoid wasps Diaparsis carnifer, Lemophagus curtis, and Tetrastichus julis.

Many species show yellowing of leaves, often with main leaf veins remaining green. In some species, young leaves are the most affected, but in others both old and new leaves show the symptoms. New leaves are often smaller and narrower and have wavy margins. Over time, the yellow (chlorotic) spots can turn a bronze colour and dead (necrotic) spots may start to develop from the margins. In some crops, zinc-deficient leaves often have shortened internodes, so leaves are clustered on the stem (rosetting). Leaf deformation and reduced growth may occur, caused by restricted development of new leaves (dwarf leaves) and reduced internode length.","Application of organic manure to the seedbed or field a few days after transplanting helps to reduce the chance of zinc deficiency occurring. Use a fertiliser containing zinc (Zn).
Example: Zinc sulphate (ZnSO4) is commonly used for foliar sprays.
Consult your agricultural advisor to know the best product and dosage for your soil and crop.
Further recommendations:
It is recommended to do a soil test before the start of the cropping season to optimise your crop production.
Soil application of zinc should be done before sowing.
Seed coating with zinc can provide the nutrient to the crop. Further recommendations:","Zinc deficiency is mainly a problem in alkaline (high pH) sandy soils that are low in organic matter. High levels of soil phosphorus and calcium (calcareous soils) also affect the availability of zinc to plants. In fact, phosphorus application can show negative effects on zinc uptake. The addition of calcium-rich materials such as limestone or chalk (liming) also offsets soil acidity and reduces the uptake of zinc by the plants (even though the levels in the soil remain unchanged). Zinc deficiency can also become a problem when soils are cool and wet during the vegetative phase.",Apply organic manure before seeding or transplanting. Do not lime soils as this increases the pH and hinders zinc uptake. Choose varieties that are tolerant to zinc deficiency or better at mining zinc from the soil. Use fertilisers including zinc compounds. Use fertilisers based on urea (that generate acidity) rather than on ammonium sulfate. Make sure not to over-fertilise with phosphorus. Monitor the quality of the irrigation water regularly. Allow permanently flooded fields to drain and dry out periodically.

In the pre-emergence phase, the fungus colonizes the seeds just after sowing, causing seed rot and stopping germination. In the post-emergence phase, seedlings grow poorly and the base of the stem starts to rot. The stem is visible as soft and slimy with water-soaked, grey, brown or black lesions. Young plants or trees become chlorotic and start to wilt, eventually toppling down, appearing as if they have been cut off at the base. White or grey mold-like growth appears on dead plants or on the soil surface. When seedling loss is extensive, replanting may be necessary.","Biofungicides based on fungi Trichoderma viride, Beauveria bassiana or the bacteria Pseudomonas fluorescens and Bacillus subtilis can be used as seed treatment or applied around the root zone at the time of planting to prevent or control the pre-emergence form of damping off. In some cases, the preventive treatment of seeds with copper fungicides such as copper oxychloride or Bordeaux mixture help to reduce the incidence and severity of the disease. Homemade solutions based on plant extracts of Eupatorium cannabinum completely inhibit the growth of the fungus.

Stressful conditions, such as water-logging or high nitrogen application, weaken the plants and also favor the development of the disease. Spores are disseminated via contaminated tools or equipment and mud on clothes or shoes. Event though they can attack crops during their whole life cycle, germinating seeds or young seedlings are more susceptible. The disease is not necessarily carried over from one season to another in the same place, but rather appears when and where conditions favor infection.","Use seeds from healthy plants or from certified sources. Use resistant varieties if available. Use raised beds in sites with poor drainage or with wet soils. Keep a wider space between seeds or seedlings at planting to favor the drying of the canopy. Do not plant seedlings too deep when transplanting. Remove infected plants as the first symptoms appear. Plan a balanced fertilization with split nitrogen applications. Water regularly but superficially. Water early in the morning so that the soil surface is dry by evening. Adopt the ring method of irrigation so that the water does not come in direct contact with the stem. Take care not to inadvertently transport mud from one field to another.

Products based on chlorantraniliprole, chloropyrifos, cypermethrin, alpha- and zeta-cypermethrin, emamectin benzoate, esfenvalerate, flubendiamide, or indoxacarb can be used (usually @ 2.5 ml/l). The first application should be at the flowering stage and followed by sprays at 10-15 days interval. Chemical treatment may not be viable in low-value crops.","The damage is caused by the caterpillar of Helicoverpa armigera, a common pest in a number of crops. H. armigera one of the most destructive pests in agriculture. Moths are light brown, with a wingspan of 3-4 cm. They generally have yellow to orange or brown forewings mottled with darker patterns. Hindwings are whitish, with dark veins and dark elongated spots on the lower edges. Females lay spherical, whitish eggs singly or in clusters on flowers or leaf surfaces, mainly on the top canopy. The larvae are olive green to dark reddish-brown, depending on the maturation stage. Their body is speckled with little black spots and they have a dark head. At later maturity stages, lines and bands develop along their back and flanks. As they reach maturity, they pupate in the soil. The population normally peaks during fruit/pod/boll development, which results in high yield loss.","Use resistant or tolerant varieties if available. Plant early to avoid population peaks of the pest. Leave sufficient distance between plants. Provide uncultivated marginal areas to break the life cycle. Place bird perches to attract birds that feed on the caterpillars. Use trap crops such as marigold (Tagitus erecta) every 5 or 6 rows. Use light or pheromone traps to monitor or mass-catch the moths. Avoid water stress by providing good drainage. Monitor plants for the presence of eggs and damage to flowers, fruit pods or bolls. Hand-pick larvae and leaves or plants with eggs. Remove infected plants from fields as well as weeds in and around the field. Clear all harvest residues after each cropping cycle. Plow deeply after harvesting to expose the pupae for natural predators and solar rays. Avoid monocultures and implement intercropping with beneficial plants."

This hinders the uptake of water and nutrients, which usually results in stunted, wilted, and discolored canopy. Emerging seedlings can also be attacked, resulting in patches of wilted growth in the field or simply gaps in the rows. Typically, the stem of the injured plants turns purple, indicating phosphorus deficiency. Cool, wet soils will exacerbate the situation because the growth of corn seedlings will be slowed and remain susceptible for a longer time.","Natural enemies that control white grubs include parasitic wasps in the genera Tiphia and Myzinum, and the species Pelecinus polyturator. Parasitic flies include the species Pyrgota undata. The fungi in the genus Cordyceps also infect the larvae and can be used in solutions to control their populations. Inoculating the soil with bacterial spores of Bacillus popilliae and Bacillus lentimorbus can also help to reduce populations. All of these products are available commercially. Always include an integrated approach with both preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Management of white grubs requires a thorough monitoring of the fields before planting to detect their presence.

Other types of beetles may be involved and therefore, it is important to learn how to recognize them. The beetles are about 12 to 25 mm long, yellow to reddish-brown or black, robust, and with an oblong shape. Larvae are whitish with a brown head and C-shaped, 20 to 45 mm in length and with three pairs of legs. The hind portion of the abdomen is dark and slightly enlarged because of the soil particles showing through the body wall. The life cycle of these insect can vary widely and this makes preventive control measures essential to keep populations in check.","Grow more tolerant varieties if available. Change planned planting date to avoid peak populations of beetles. Monitor field by digging up some plants in the affected area and looking for white grubs in the root zone. Rotate with non-host crops such as deep-rooted legumes (alfalfa or clovers). Keep the field free of grass and weed growth to reduce the number of eggs laid. Avoid to sow corn in fields previously used for soybean or potato. Expose the insects to predators with a mid-season plowing. Deep plow, remove and burn harvest residues and stubbles after harvest. Alternatively, use pasturing hogs to unearth and eat grubs. Avoid overuse of insecticides as these will also affect natural predators of white grubs."

They bore into the stems or the base of the panicle and feed on the internal substance, blocking the transport of nutrients and water. Exit holes of the caterpillar can also be observed on stems and panicles. The lack of supplies causes wilt of the affected plant parts. When opened longitudinally, the stems show ‘dead hearts’ symptoms, with the presence of larvae and frass inside.","Several parasitoid wasps of the groups Telenomeus and Trichogramma are depositing their eggs into the eggs of Sesamia inferens and help to control the population. For example, the release of egg parasitoid, Trichogramma chilonis (8 cards per hectare) at 12 and 22 days after germination. The larvae are also parasitized by the wasps Apanteles flavipes, Bracon chinensis and Sturmiopsis inferens. Finally, the pupae are attacked by species of Xanthopinpla and Tetrastichus.

In some cases, contaminated seeds can give rise to seedling blight, which is characterized by the appearance of dark brown areas on young plants. Early infection of mature plants may not produce symptoms, except for a decrease in leaf area and number of tillers. However, dark-brown areas may be present at the base of the stem (foot rot) or below ground, and on internodes and roots (root rot). Later on, as the pathogen progresses into the stem, elongated, brown-black spots appear on lower leaves. This is particularly evident during prolonged periods of rain. Diseased plants occur randomly or in irregular patches, and are stunted and often chlorotic. A common symptom of late infections is the premature bleaching of one or more spikelets or the entire head (head blight).",The fungus of Sporobolomyces roseus is a natural enemy of Cochliobolus sativus and has been used in cereals to reduce the incidence and severity of the disease. Other antagonists of this pathogen are also available. Always consider an integrated approach of both preventive measures and biological treatments if available.

It survives as mycelium or spores in soil and crop debris, and is spread by wind, rain splashes or irrigation water onto healthy plants. Beside barley, wheat and rye, it can also infect a number of species of weeds and grasses. Oat is resistant to the disease but can still contribute to the dispersal of the pathogen. When a susceptible host is found and conditions are favorable, its spores germinate and initiate a primary infection on the young plant or its roots. It penetrates plant tissues either directly through the epidermis or via natural pores or wounds. Infested seed or agricultural tools can also disseminate the pathogen over long distances and serve as inoculum for subsequent crops. The life cycle of the fungus is favored by warm temperatures (optimal 28-32ºC).",Be aware of quarantine regulation for this pathogen. Select certified disease-free seeds. Have a proper fertilization program with split application of nitrogen. Make sure to add micronutrient to fortify your crop.

Most adults are small (about 4 mm), dark-coloured, sometimes with a shiny or metallic aspect. They have an oval body and large hind legs for jumping. The larvae live in the soil and feed on roots or tubers whereas adults feed on young plants. Most flea beetles hibernate under plant residues, in the soil or on weeds around fields. They become active again during the spring. Depending on species and climate, 1-4 generations grow per year. Flea Beetles prefer warm, dry conditions.","Adjust planting times (earlier or later) to avoid periods of peak adult activity. Plant trap crops that are attractive to the flea beetle. Plant non-hosts plants that repel or block insect pests. Add organic mulch as this interferes with the egg-laying and the larval stages. Monitor your plants, especially in spring. Supply the plants with essential nutrients in the frame of a balanced fertilisation. Water regularly and in a reasonable manner. Rid your field of weeds or other host plants. Remove refuge sites by ploughing and destroying crop residues."
53,https://plantix.net/en/library/plant-diseases/900006/sunburn/,Sunburn,Abiotic Sunburn,Other,"Abiotic sunburn refers to the damage caused to plants, bushes or trees by a combination of direct sunlight and excessive temperatures. These factors alter the moisture in the plant tissues, leading initially to the wilting of young, tender leaves. These leaves gradually turn pale green and start to develop lesions near the apex and the margins after 2–3 days. The parched lesions later progress towards the middle of the leaf lamina. The defoliation caused by drought stress or insect attack can also lead to sunscalds to fruit or bark, since these are not shaded by the leaves anymore. In the bark they can take the form of cracks and cankers, which eventually develop into dead areas on the trunk.","White clay or talc formulations can be sprayed on foliage and trunk to physically block the sunlight. This may reduce temperatures by 5-10 °C. Products based on calcium carbonate or crystalline limestone are also recommended. Carnauba wax products serve as a natural sunscreen to plants. Always consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Abscisic acid applied as a fertilizer supplement helps to reduce sunburn damage to fruits such as apples and may therefore also work in other crops. Anti-transpirant products that reduce water loss by the leaves, such as those based on poly-1-P menthene, have also shown good results in some studies.

Altitude also plays a role since the ultraviolet (UV) radiation is greater at higher elevations. Symptoms are visible on leaves, fruits and bark. The incidence and severity of sunburn also depends on factors such as the variety of plant, its growth stage and soil moisture. Sunburn is particularly severe when air temperature and the number of sunny hours are high during the ripening period. The alternation of weather events is also important: thus, damage can also occur when cool or mild weather is abruptly followed by hot, sunny weather.",Use varieties that are more tolerant to sunburn. Make sure that the irrigation is well-matched with the crop's water requirements. Irrigate just before heat waves to avoid plant stress and sunburn. Avoid excessive summer pruning and leaf stripping. Improve air movement through the canopy. Implement a plant or tree sprinkler cooling system. Shade netting or fruit bagging can also be applied if needed. Use cover crops between the rows to enhance soil water retention capacity (maize or pigeon pea in pineapple orchard for example).

Goss’s wilt primarily infects leaves that have been wounded, for example, by hail, sand-blasting, and strong storms. The disease spreads within the plant following leaf infection, and can then be transmitted from plant to plant. Disease development is favored by warm temperatures (>25 °C). Symptoms often become most visible after silking, and increase in severity after that stage. The disease is favored by planting susceptible hybrids, reduced tillage, and monocultures.","Plant resistant varieties, if available in your area (several are on the market). Monitor the field regularly for symptoms of the disease. Maintain a high standard of hygiene with all tools involved in the cultivation. Keep mechanical damages to plants as low as possible. Remove plant residues by for example deep plowing. Rotate crops every second year to allow for decomposition of any remaining corn residues. Remove alternative hosts like green foxtail, barnyardgrass and shattercane."

The veins of middle and upper (young) leaves of manganese-deficient plants remain green while the rest of the leaf blade first becomes pale green, then develops a mottled pattern with pale green to yellow areas (interveinal chlorosis). Over time, small necrotic lesions develop on the chlorotic tissues, particularly near the margins and tips (tip burn). Reduced leaf size, deformation and curling of leaf margins are other possible symptoms. If not amended, brown necrotic spots may develop on the leaf surfaces, and severely affected leaves turn brown and wither. Not to be confused with Magnesium deficiency, whose symptoms are similar but develop first on older leaves.","Use manure, organic mulches or compost to balance the nutrient content and the pH of the soils. These contain organic matter that increases the humus content of the soil and its water-holding capacity and decrease slightly the pH. Use a fertilizer containing manganese (Mn).
Example: Manganese sulfate (Mn 30.5%) is commonly used for soil and foliar applications.
Consult your agricultural advisor to know the best product and dosage for your soil and crop.
Further recommendations:
It is recommended to do a soil test before the start of the cropping season to optimize your crop production. Further recommendations:","Manganese (Mn) deficiency is a widespread problem, most often occurring in sandy soils, organic soils with a pH above 6 and heavily weathered, tropical soils. In contrast, highly-acidic soils increase the availability of this nutrient. Excessive or unbalanced use of fertilizers may also result in some micronutrients competing with each other to become available to the plant. Mn has an important role in photosynthesis and nitrate assimilation. Like iron, boron and calcium, manganese is immobile within the plant, accumulating mostly in the lower leaves. This explains why the symptoms develop first on young leaves. Crops showing a high susceptibility to Mn deficiency and a positive response to fertilization with this nutrient are: cereals, legumes, stone fruits, palm crops, citrus, sugar beets and canola, among others.",Check the pH of the soil and adjust if necessary to get the optimal range for best absorption of the nutrients. Plan a good drainage of fields and do not over-water the crop. Use organic mulch to keep soil moisture stable. Always keep in mind that only a balanced fertilization can lead to optimal plant health and increased yield.
67,https://plantix.net/en/library/plant-diseases/700004/magnesium-deficiency/,Magnesium Deficiency,Magnesium Deficiency,Deficiency,"Magnesium-deficient plants generally develop a mottled pale green or chlorotic pattern in the interveinal tissue of older leaves, often starting near the margin. In cereal, leaves with mild deficiencies develop a green linear beading that progresses to interveinal chlorosis. In severe cases, the yellowing progresses to the middle of the leaf and the small veins also become affected. Reddish or brown spots appear on the leaf blade. Later on, the development of necrotic areas in the highly chlorotic tissue gives the leaves a rugged and deformed aspect. Finally, the yellowing engulfs the whole leaf, eventually leading to premature death and early shedding. Root growth is inhibited, resulting in poor plant vigour.","Apply substances that contain magnesium such as algal limestone, dolomite or limestone magnesium. Use manure, organic mulches or compost to balance the soil nutrient content. They contain organic matter and many nutrients that are released slowly into the soil. Use fertilisers containing magnesium (Mg).
Examples: magnesium oxide, magnesium sulphate (MgSO4).

Magnesium can be applied directly to the soil or with foliar sprays. Further recommendations:","Magnesium deficiency is a common problem in light, sandy, or acidic soils with low nutrient and water retention capacity. In those soils, nutrients can be easily leached away. Soils rich in potassium or ammonium or the excess application of these nutrients can also be problematic because they compete with magnesium in the soil. Magnesium is involved in sugar transport and is an important part of the chlorophyll molecules. Without sufficient amounts of magnesium, the plants begin to degrade the chlorophyll in the older leaves to transfer it to the newer developing ones. This explains the development of interveinal chlorosis. Light intensity influences the development of the symptoms. High light worsens the effects of a deficiency.",Check the pH of the soil and lime if necessary to get the optimal range. Plan a good drainage of fields and do not overwater the crop.

These characteristics are similar to those observed in nitrogen-deficient plants and can be easily confused. They are first observable in new, upper leaves in the case of sulfur deficiency. In some crops, interveinal yellowing or spotting of the leaf blade may be observed instead (wheat and potato). Leaves usually also grow smaller and narrower and may have necrotic tips. Affected areas in the field can appear pale green or bright yellow from a distance. Stems grow thinner, with inhibited longitudinal growth. If the deficiency starts early in the season, stunted growth of the plant, impaired flowering and delayed maturity of the fruits/grains may ensue. After transplanting, seedlings growing in sulfur-poor soils are likely to have higher mortality rates than normal.","A compost mix of animal manure and leaves or plant mulch is ideal to provide plants with organic matter and nutrients such as sulfur and boron.

Apply citric acid if your soil pH is too high to help your crop uptake sulfur. Further recommendations:","Sulfur deficiency is not particularly common in either nature or agriculture. Sulfur is mobile in the soil and can be easily be leached downwards with water movements. That explains why deficiencies are associated with soils with low organic matter, highly weathered soils, sandy soils or soil with high pH. Most of the sulfur in soil is contained in soil organic matter or is attached to clay minerals. Bacteria in the soil make it available to plants in a process known as mineralization. This process is favored by high temperatures because of the enhanced activity of these microorganisms and their increased number. It is immobile in plants and does not readily translocate from older leaves to young leaves. Therefore, the deficiencies first appear on younger leaves.",Apply sulfur to the nursery seedbed by using fertilizers. Incorporate straw into the soil instead of completely removing or burning it.

Fipronil 2 ml or thiamethoxam (0.2 g) or flonicamid (0.3 g) or acetamiprid (0.2 per liter of water) can also be used. However, these chemicals can have negative impacts on predators, parasitoids, and pollinators.","Aphids are small, soft-bodied insects with long legs and antennae. Their size ranges from 0.5 to 2 mm and the colour of their body can be yellow, brown, red or black, depending on the species. Their aspect ranges from the wingless varieties, that are generally predominant, to the winged, waxy or woolly types.Optimal conditions for their growth are dry and warm climates. They usually settle and feed in clusters on the underside of well-fed young leaves and shoot tips. They use their long mouth parts to pierce tender plant tissues and suck out fluids. After an initial invasion in late spring or early summer, the aphid population usually diminishes naturally due to natural enemies. Several species carry plant viruses that can lead to the development of other diseases.","Maintain a high number of different varieties of plants around fields. Remove plant debris from previous cultures. Use reflective mulches to repel invading populations of aphids. Monitor fields regularly to assess the incidence of a disease or pest and determine their severity. Remove infected plant parts. Check weeds in and around the fields. Do not over-water or over-fertilise. Control ant populations that protect aphids with sticky bands. Prune the branches of your trees or remove the bottom leaves of your plants to favour the ventilation of the canopy. If possible, use nets to protect the plants. Control insecticide use in order not to affect beneficial insects."

On susceptible varieties, the infection is characterized by three distinct phases: leaf blight, top dieback, and stalk rot. Small, oval, water-soaked lesions appear first on lower leaves, near leaf tip or mid rib, and later on the upper ones. They develop into translucent spots with tan centers and purplish margins and can coalesce to form patches of blight that cover the whole leaf (leaf blight). At later stages of plant growth, dark, raised specks appear on dead tissue if the conditions are favorable. Injuries to stalks and stems favor the colonization of internal tissues which leads to other symptoms such as top dieback and stalk rot.","We don't know of any effective treatment against Colletotrichum graminicola. Please get in touch with us in case you know of anything that might help to fight this disease. Looking forward to hearing from you. Always consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. To date, there are no effective fungicides available. Always consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. To date, there are no effective fungicides available.","The fungus survives in plant residues in the soil, from where it is distributed onto the lower leaves by wind and splashing rain during spring. The lesions that develop on leaf blades cause secondary spreading to upper foliage or stalks. Stalk injury increases the likelihood of the colonization of internal tissues. If environmental conditions are propitious other symptoms such as top dieback and stalk rot appear consequently. The life cycle of the fungus (and disease) is favored by relatively warm temperatures (20 to 30°C), high relative humidity for a prolonged period, and frequent rainfall. The fungus can infect plants at the seedling stage but it rarely causes substantial yield loss if the fields are suitably fertilized. Rapidly expanding leaves are less prone to developing symptoms.","Plant resistant varieties if available in your market. Plan a long-term crop rotation with non-host crops (non-grass crops or soybean). Monitor the fields for the presence of symptoms, for example stalk rot. Maintain balanced soil fertility and stable pH-levels. Provide the fields with good drainage. Control weeds in and around the fields. Plow deep after harvest and bury residues."

If infested during the vegetative state, they bore through the terminal buds of the shoots and move downward. This causes drying and shedding of terminal shoots before flowering. If the main stem is affected, the whole plant might collapse. When attacked in a later stage, the larvae will bore holes at the base of buds and bolls to feed inside. The tunnel entrance is often blocked by excrement. Damaged flower buds sometimes spread prematurely and so-called flared squares can be observed. Damage to the plant tissue can lead to fungal or bacterial infections. The younger the plant, the more damage the spotted bollworm can cause.","Scouting for eggs or small larvae is essential in the management of this pest. Some parasitoid insects of the family Braconidae, Scelionidae and Trichogrammatidae can be used as a biological control method. Also try predatory insects from the following orders: Coleoptera, Hymenoptera, Hemiptera, and Neuroptera. Make sure to promote these species (or even introduce them to the field), and avoid the use of broad-scale pesticides. You can apply bioinsecticide sprays containing Bacillus thuringiensis to control population peaks. Spray Neem seed kernel extracts (NSKE) 5% or Neem oil (1500ppm) @ 5ml/l. Always consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Treatment is recommended when 10 eggs or five small worms per 100 plants are present during early bloom. As larvae become increasingly resilient to insecticidal treatment while growing, scouting for eggs and young larvae is crucial. Treatment is recommended to be applied during the egg stage. Insecticides containing chlorantraniliprole, emamectin benzoate, flubendiamide, or esfenvalerate can be applied. Chemical treatment may be inviable in low-value crops.

Chemical treatment may be inviable in low-value crops.","The damage is caused by the larvae of the spiny bollworm, Earias insulana, a common pest in the northern regions of India. Alternative host plants for this pest are, among others, hibiscus and okra. The moths are silver-green to yellow in color, approximately 2 cm long and can be seen on flowers or close to light sources. Three darker streaks can be seen on the wings. Green forms are common during summer while yellow and brownish colors appear in fall. Eggs are of blue in color, singly laid on young shoots, leaves, and squares. The young larvae are light brown with grey to yellow and orange features. They can be best distinguished from most other caterpillars by the tiny spines, visible under a hand lens, that cover most of the body surface. As they reach maturity, they pupate in a silken cocoon attached to leaves or fallen plant parts. Under tropic conditions, a generation is complete within 20-25 days. Low temperatures can delay the process to a length of up to two months.","Plant resilient varieties, if available in your area. Avoid monocultures and implement intercropping with beneficial plants. Ensure early planting to avoid peak populations. Provide uncultivated marginal areas to break life cycle or plant trap crops like hibiscus and okra. Leave sufficient distance between plants. Monitor the cotton field regularly for larvae and eggs of the spiny bollworm. Keep up a sufficient fertilization. Promote an early harvest. Clear all harvest residues after each cropping cycle.

82,https://plantix.net/en/library/plant-diseases/800003/nematodes/,Nematodes,Nematoda,Other,"Infestation with nematodes can show different patterns of damage, depending on the specific species, their numbers and the host plant. Some nematodes cause their host plants to increase their root production and form root knots or gall structure. Others cause extensive root lesions and a degradation of the root internal tissues. In many cases, secondary attacks by fungi or soil bacteria occur at these lesions. Water and nutrients do not reach the aerial parts of the plant. Infested plants have a stunted growth and their leaves may turn yellow, with signs of wilting and deformation. Sometimes the stems are also affected.",Biological control agents can work in some cases. The fungi Nematophora gynophila and Verticillium chlamydosporium have been associated with the reduction an/or suppression of some nematodes in cereals for example. Application of extracts of marigold (Tagetes patula) and calendula (Calendula officinalis) to the soil can reduce populations to a certain degree. Always consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Treatments are dependent on the type of nematode in question. The use of nematicides (dazomet) applied as soil fumigants can be effective to decrease populations but not economically beneficial for most farmers.

Treatments are dependent on the type of nematode in question. The use of nematicides (dazomet) applied as soil fumigants can be effective to decrease populations but not economically beneficial for most farmers. Some of these products can also be used as foliar sprays.,"Nematodes are microscopic roundworms that live mostly in soils, from where they can infest the roots of host plants. In general, they are beneficial organisms, yet when their population reaches a critical number, they can cause plant damage. They are characterized by the presence of a stylet, which they used to penetrate roots and underground parts of plants, and in some cases leaves and flowers. Nematodes have different feeding strategies and can survive several years in the soil. They multiply via intermediate hosts. They also transmit diseases caused by bacteria, viruses or fungi.","If available, use resistant or tolerant plant varieties. Intercropping the fields with marigold or calendula or sowing flower strips between the crops can also reduce populations. Cover the seedbeds with plastic mulch for several weeks to kills the nematodes. Plow the field and expose the soil to solar radiation (solarization). In case of heavy infestation, consider a bare fallow of several months. Ensure diversified crop rotation over several years."
83,https://plantix.net/en/library/plant-diseases/800070/european-earwig/,European Earwig,Forficula auricularia,Insect,"Earwigs thrive in garden, orchard and field environments and feed on foliage and fruits. Leaves with chewed edges or irregular holes are characteristic for earwig feeding. This damage can be of little concern in mature, otherwise healthy trees. However, the feeding on young seedlings or tender shoot-tip on young trees may lead to stunted growth. Damaged seedlings may be missing all or parts of their leaves and stem. On soft fruits, earwigs cause shallow, irregular marks or holes on the surface that can extend deeply in the flesh. Their activity is also denoted by black dots of excrement around feeding sites. If you are unsure whether the damage is from earwigs, inspect the tree after sunset with a flashlight as earwigs are most active at night.","Formulations containing spinosad can be applied on organically grown apricots. Trap earwigs with rolled-up newspapers or small tin cans filled with oil and set in the soil. Check traps in the morning and dispose of earwigs in soapy water. Always consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Earwigs are beneficial where aphids are problematic and eliminating all earwigs with a chemical treatment could cause other pest populations to increase. Insecticides are recommended in severe csaes, and they should be applied on the trunk and base of trees at night to avoid a negative impact on bees.

They sometimes hibernate in pairs in the soil during the winter and emerge when conditions are favorable. Females lay eggs twice during the season, so that there can be two distinct nymph hatchings, one in the late spring and one in the early summer. They feed most actively at night and seek out dark, cool, moist places during the day. Fallen branches or fruits, boards and densely packed weeds provide shelter to this insect. In areas with particularly hot summers, earwigs may be relatively inactive. Their presence or damage may go unnoticed until harvest. As omnivores, they also feed on insects, particularly plant-feeding aphids. Earwigs are both pests and beneficial insects depending on where you find them.","Monitor the orchard regularly for presence of earwigs. Remove weeds from around the base of trees. Keep orchard clear of pruned branches, suckers, loose bark, or debris under which earwigs could nest. Remove tree parts that come in contact with soil to prevent access to trees. Use a sticky tape around the base of the tree to prevent earwigs from climbing up to reach the fruit."
84,https://plantix.net/en/library/plant-diseases/700002/potassium-deficiency/,Potassium Deficiency,Potassium Deficiency,Deficiency,"Symptoms are mainly visible on older leaves and start to develop on young leaves only in the case of severe deficiencies. Mild potassium deficiency is characterized by the development of mild yellowing at the margins and tips of the leaves, later followed by tip burn. The leaf blade turns somewhat paler but the main veins remain dark green (interveinal chlorosis). If not amended, these chlorotic patches turn into a dry, leathery tan or dark brown scorch (necrosis) that usually progresses from the leaf edge to the midrib. However, the main veins tend to remain green. Leaves tend to curl and crinkle and often collapse prematurely. Young leaves remain small and dull, assuming a cupped appearance. Potassium-deficient plants grow stunted and are more susceptible to diseases and other stresses such as drought and frost. In some cases, fruits may be severely deformed.","Add organic matter in the form of ashes or plant mulch to the soil at least once a year. Wood ash also has high potassium content. Liming acidic soils can increase potassium retention in some soils by reducing leaching. Use fertilizers containing potassium (K).
Examples: muriate of potash (MOP), potassium nitrate (KNO3).
Consult your agricultural advisor to know the best product and dosage for your soil and crop.
Further recommendations:
It's recommended to do a soil test before the start of the cropping season to optimize your crop production.
It's best to apply fertilizers during field preparation and at flowering.
Crops take up potassium more efficiently through soil fertilization than from foliar sprays. Further recommendations:","Deficiencies may occur because of low reserves of potassium in the soil or limited availability to the plant. Soils with low pH and sandy or light soils with little organic content are prone to nutrient leaching and drought, and may, therefore, cause problems. Heavy irrigation and high rainfall wash the nutrients from the root zone and can also lead to deficiency. Hot temperatures or drought conditions block the transport of water and nutrients to the plants. High levels of phosphorus, magnesium, and iron can also compete with potassium. Potassium plays an essential role in the transport of water, the firmness of tissues and the exchange of gases with the atmosphere. The symptoms of potassium deficiency are irreversible, even if potassium is later added to the plants.",Highly acidic or alkaline soils often lead to major and minor element deficiencies. Check the pH of the soil and lime if necessary to get the optimal range. Cultivate varieties that are more efficient in the uptake of potassium. Ensure a balanced use of fertilizers to secure proper nutrients supply to the plant. Add organic matter to the soil in the form of manure or plant mulch. Water plants regularly and avoid flooding of fields.
85,https://plantix.net/en/library/plant-diseases/700003/calcium-deficiency/,Calcium Deficiency,Calcium Deficiency,Deficiency,"The symptoms are primarily visible in the rapidly growing tissues like new shoots and leaves. Young shoots are poorly developed and over time their number is reduced. Initially, the new or intermediary leaves may show randomly scattered chlorotic stains in the limb. If not amended, they start to curl downward or upward and their edges take gradually a necrotic and scorched aspect. Mature and older leaves are generally unaffected. The root system develops poorly and plants have a tendency to wilt and show stunted growth. With a severe deficiency, flowers can abort, and the growing point of new leaves appear burnt or simply die. Fruits are smaller and unsavory, and in the case of cucumber, pepper and tomato may develop rot at the blossom end. Seeds have a lower germination rate.","For small farmers or gardeners, crushed eggshells ground very finely and mixed with a weak acid (vinegar) can be used. Alternatively, apply calcium-rich substances such as algal limestone, basalt flour, burnt lime, dolomite, gypsum, and slag lime. Organic matter in the form of manure or compost can be added to the soil in order to improve its moisture-retaining capacity. Use soil fertilisers containing calcium (Ca).
Examples: Calcium nitrate, lime, gypsum.
Consult your agricultural advisor to know the best product and dosage for your soil and crop.
Further recommendations:
It is recommended to do a soil test before the start of the cropping season to optimize your crop production.
Soluble calcium nitrate is a foliar spray for existing deficiency.
When using calcium chloride, do not spray if the temperature is over 30°C.
During field preparation, use lime if the soil pH is acidic and use gypsum if the soil pH is alkaline.
Liming can be performed two to four months before planting. Further recommendations:","Symptoms are generally related to the availability of this nutrient to the plant rather than to low soil supply. Calcium is not mobile in the plant and its absorption is tightly linked to the uptake and transport of water in the plant. That explains why new leaves are first to show deficiency symptoms. Heavy soils and irrigated soils are good at dissolving calcium and bringing it to the plant. However, sandy soils, with a poor water retention capacity, are prone to drought and can limit its uptake. Allowing the soil to dry out too much between watering can also cause the symptoms. Soils with low pH, high salinity or soils rich in ammonium can also be problematic. High air humidity or flooding of soils can slow down the transport of water to tissues, and therefore less calcium is absorbed.","Choose varieties that are better at mining calcium from the soil. Make sure to test the soil pH and lime if necessary to get within the optimal range between 7.0 and 8.5. Reduce the use of ammonium-based fertilisers to avoid insufficient calcium availability in the soil. Do not over-fertilise with nitrogen during early fruit development. Be careful not to injure the roots if working near the plants. Ensure frequent watering, but do not over-water. Add organic matter to the soil, for example, manure or organic mulch or compost. Green mulch (straw, decomposed sawdust) or plastic mulch can help the soil to retain moisture. Monitor the field regularly and remove fruits with symptoms."

As the disease progresses, the specks enlarge and become more numerous. The resulting patches or bands of diseased tissue may cover a good portion of the leaf. Their color usually varies from yellowish to brown and they are reminiscent of the symptoms caused by some sorts of rusts. However, contrarily to rust diseases, P. maydis lesions frequently develop in distinct bands across the leaf, particularly at its base. Another difference is that conspicuous dark brown to black spots appear on or immediately close to the main vein. In susceptible varieties, the middle vein may be covered with these lesions, and may turn from chocolate to reddish brown or purple in color.",There is no biological treatment against P. maydis available at the moment. Please notify us if you know of any. Cultural control is the most important practice to avoid its occurrence and possible outbreaks. Always consider an integrated approach with preventive measures and biological treatments if available. There is no recommended chemical treatment against P. maydis as the occurrence is sporadic and the effect on yield should be minimal.

There is no recommended chemical treatment against P. maydis as the occurrence is sporadic and the effect on yield should be minimal.,"Symptoms are caused by Physoderma maydis, a fungus that overwinters in infected crops debris or soil (up to 7 years in favorable conditions). The disease is more common in fields with continuous corn or with abundant crop residues, for example where reduced tillage practices are employed. Infection usually start in the whorl, where water tend to accumulate after rainfall or irrigation. From there, the secondary inoculum is spread via wind or splashing water to other plant whorls. This explains why symptoms are more conspicuous at the base of older leaves. Optimal conditions of light and temperature are also needed for that. Overall, this disease is not serious and has minor effect on yields.","Monitor the field regularly for signs of the disease. Practice a wide crop rotation, as the fungus survives in infected crop residue or the soil for 2-7 years. Remove crop residues by deep tillage or burning in distance to the field."

Symptoms develop on leaves, sheaths and stalks and can later spread to ears. On leaves and sheaths, a number of soaked, discolored concentric bands and rings are visible, often brown, tan or gray in color. Usually, the symptoms appear initially on the first and second leaf sheath above the ground. Over time, a conspicuous light brown cottony growth with small, round, black specks develops on infected tissues and can later spread to the ears. Developing cob is completely damaged and dried prematurely with cracking of husk leaves. Severity of disease is dependent on the stage of ear development at the time of infection. If seedlings are affected, growing points die and whole plants could be blighted within a week.","To reduce incidence and severity of the disease, maize seeds can be sterilized for 10 minutes in 1% sodium hypochlorite solution and 5% ethanol, washed three times with water and dried. An added treatment with formulations containing Bacillus subtilis enhances this effect. Products containing the fungus Trichoderma harzianum or T. viridi have also been used to successfully limit the spread of the disease. Always consider an integrated approach with both preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Maize seeds can be treated in a preventive way with captan, thiram or metalaxyl, washed three times with sterile distilled water and air-dried.

In response to favorable humidity and temperatures (15 to 35°C, optimal 30°C) at the onset of the growing season, fungal growth resumes and targets freshly-planted host crops. At 70% relative humidity, disease development is negligible/absent, whereas at 90-100 % R.H, highest level of disease is induced. The fungi spread by irrigation water, flooding and transport of contaminated soils in equipment or clothes. The disease is more prevalent in humid and hot weather in the tropics and subtropics. It is extremely difficult to control with fungicides and therefore, a combination of management practices is often required.","Use resistant varieties, if available. Avoid high crop densities in the field. Remove and burn infected plants after harvest. Make sure to keep the field clean and not to injure plants. Strip off the lower infected leaves touching the soil along with their sheaths. Crop rotation may help to control the spread of the disease to some degree."

Plants contaminated during the vegetative stage show stunted growth, wilt and chlorosis. During later plant stages, the fungi can infect the ears, insect lesions or mechanical injuries can serve as entry points. Mechanical injuries can occur during field work or harvest. Elevated temperatures and high humidities lead to the growth of a moldy blue-green growth on the cob surface and on the kernels.

They feed inside whorls or midribs first, and tunnel into the stalks at the base of the plant, silk and ears later. They destroy internal tissues that transport water and nutrients, leading to stunted growth, fewer leaves and lower productivity. The tunneling of the stalk weakens the bearing capacity of the plant and favors lodging. The ears have round holes with wet frass, damaged kernels, and they may drop. The holes are used by opportunistic fungi to colonize the plant, with the consequent development of rot in those tissues. The toxins produced by these fungi further worsen the quality of the yield.","Controlling european corn borer populations with predators, parasitoids and bio-insecticides is possible. Native predators include insidious flower bugs (Orius insidiosus), green lacewings and several ladybirds. Birds can also eliminate 20 to 30% of the overwintering larvae. Parasitoids include the tachinid fly Lydella thompsoni and wasps of the species Eriborus terebrans, Simpiesis viridula and Macrocentris grandii. Bio-insecticides based on Spinosad or Bacillus thuringiensis also work. Numerous insecticides can be used to control borer populations. They have to be applied in a timely manner.

Here are some common symptoms of leaf-footed bug damage in crops. Leaf-footed bugs can cause slowed growth in plants, particularly in young plants that are still developing. This can result in smaller yields or a delayed harvest. These bugs can cause discoloration and deformity in fruit. Affected fruit may appear discolored, misshapen, or have small sunken areas on the surface. This can make the fruit less marketable because of these visible damages. Leaf-footed bugs can cause damage to the leaves and stems of plants. This can result in yellowing or browning of the leaves, wilting, and even death of the plant. In addition, some species of leaf-footed bugs can transmit plant diseases, which can further damage crops and reduce yields.","Insecticidal soap or botanicals, such as neem oil or pyrethrin, may provide some control of young nymphs only. One of the best ways to control leaf-footed bugs is to remove their eggs. Chemical control of leaf-footed bugs involves using insecticides to kill or repel the pests.

They are medium-sized insects, usually about 20 mm long. They are usually brown or green, and they feed on the sap of plants, such as fruits, vegetables, and nuts. The life cycle of a leaf-footed bug starts when the female lays eggs on plants. The eggs are about 1.4 mm long, oval-shaped, bronze to dark brown and are laid in rows. The eggs hatch into small nymphs, which look like smaller versions of the adult bugs. The nymphs go through several transformations before becoming adults. During each transformation, the nymph sheds its old skin and grows a new one. As they grow, they start to look more like adults, and they develop wings. Once the leaf-footed bugs become adults, they mate and lay eggs, and the cycle starts again. Leaf-footed bugs can go through several generations per year, depending on the climate and the availability of food. They are more likely to cause problems when it rains a lot. Adults come out of hiding in the spring after spending the winter under dead plants or mulch. If the winter is warm, more adult insects survive and can cause more problems. Some types of leaf-footed bugs only reproduce on weeds, while others reproduce on vegetables. Fruit damage is the main concern with these insects, and they are most likely to cause problems around the time that the fruits start to form.","Check your plants regularly for signs of leaf-footed bug activity, such as egg masses, discolored fruit, sunken areas on fruit, and damage to leaves and stems. You can use physical barriers, such as row covers or netting, to keep leaf-footed bugs away from your plants. Remove weeds from your fields because leaf-footed bugs can hide and feed on weeds. Keep your fields clean by removing fallen fruit or other debris that could attract leaf-footed bugs. Attract or introduce natural predators (birds, spiders, and predatory insects) that can help control leaf-footed bugs by providing shelter and water. Practice good field sanitation as the end of the season to reduce the chances of the insect to survive until the next season."

Each plant can produce between 90,000 and 500,000 seeds, which can remain in the soil for periods of over 10 years. These seeds overwinter in the soil after their dispersal by wind, water, animal, or human machinery. When weather conditions are favorable and they are within a few centimeters of a host root, they will begin to germinate. Once in contact with the root, the witchweed produces a structure that attaches it to the host plant, thus establishing a parasitic relationship. Nitrogen-rich fertilizers also reduces the witchweed infection rate.","Use fortifiers for a general strengthening of the crops. Apply manure generously at the beginning of the season. Sow plants of the genus Desmodium in the fields to prevent Striga from attaching to the roots of the crop. Planting napier grass around the field also helps pulling striga away of the main crops.

It is recommended to do a soil test before the start of the cropping season to optimize your crop production. Further recommendations:","There are differences in susceptibility to phosphorus deficiency between different crops. Roots absorb phosphate ions when they are dissolved in the soil water. Calcareous soils with high calcium concentrations can be poor in phosphorus. Most commonly, however, it is the availability of this nutrient that is limited because phosphorus is adhered to soil particles and cannot be taken up by the plant. Both alkaline soils and acidic soils can show low availability. Soils with low organic matter or iron-rich soils can also be problematic. Cold weather that hinders proper development and function of the roots can also lead to this disorder. Drought conditions or diseases that limit the absorption of water and nutrients by the roots can trigger deficiency symptoms. Soil moisture, in turn, increases the uptake of this nutrient and results in significantly higher yields.",Use varieties that are efficient at mining phosphorus from the soil. Ensure balanced and efficient fertilization of the crop. Incorporate plant residues into the soil after harvest.

Birds and spiders can also help to reduce infestation. The oil of Eucalyptus urograndis is toxic to the bugs and their nymphs. Always consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Seed treatments with insecticides of the pyrethroids group may provide some control and avoid damage in seedlings. Foliar application of insecticides based on bifenthrin can also help to control populations.

Adults of the brown stink bug are shield-shaped with mottled brown, leathery wings and a characteristic triangular pattern on their back. Eggs are barrel-shaped and laid in clusters on the leaves. Nymphs are nearly round and black and wingless. Adults and nymphs damage the plant with their sucking mouthparts, piercing tissues and injecting substances to digest the content, then re-ingesting the dissolved plant material. This causes malformation or stunted growth, even more so if populations are large. On fruits and seeds, the feeding causes stains and imperfections that impact the quality of the product. Stink bugs have a wide range of alternative hosts like weeds and several grains crops such as soybeans, vegetables and alfalfa.",Plant early to avoid peak populations. Barriers between fields can help to reduce the migrations of the bug. Monitor regularly and rid the field of weeds. Clear the field of plant residues after harvesting. No-tillage practices or the presence of mulch favors the risk of infestation.
104,https://plantix.net/en/library/plant-diseases/600006/codling-moth/,Codling Moth,Cydia pomonella,Insect,"Damage is caused by the feeding of the larvae in fruits. Shallow entries points are visible on the fruit skin and correspond to aborted entries, where the larvae died or gave up and tried another place. In case of successful entry, the larvae penetrate into the flesh of the fruit and can reach the core to feed on seeds. The entry holes are surrounded by a red ring and capped with reddish-brown, crumbly larval droppings called frass. When the fruit is cut open, the small white caterpillar can sometimes be found near the core. Damaged fruits tend to ripen and drop early or are simply unmarketable. If left uncontrolled, larvae can cause substantial damage, often infesting 20 to 90% of the fruits, depending on the variety and location. Deep entries can be a severe problem in stored fruit because they are colonized by bacteria and fungi that lead them to rot. Late maturing varieties are more likely to suffer severe damage than early varieties.","Codling moth granulosis virus (CYD-X) can be applied in weekly intervals, starting when moths or fruit stings have been first observed. The virus only affects the moth's larvae and should be sprayed and mixed with 1% oil. Insecticides like spinosad are also recommended for pest control, however it is far less efficient than other non-organic solutions. Beneficial nematodes that penetrate and destroy immature stages of this pest are commercially available. Wettable kaolin clay can also be used to deter this pest and can reduce damage by 50-60%.

Adults are active only a few hours before and after sunset, and they mate when sunset temperatures exceed 16°C. The first generation of moths hatches in spring or early summer, just before bloom. One or two weeks after they start flying, the moths lay eggs on the fruits, usually one per fruit. Small larvae hatch from these eggs and chew on the skin, boring an opening into the fruits. It takes three to five weeks for the caterpillar to develop completely. Mature larvae drop off the fruits and find a place to hide, e.g. in cracks in the trunk. The second generation hatches in late summer or early autumn. This generation damages the ripe fruits until they leave to find shelter in which to hibernate.","Choose early-maturing varieties. Check plants and fruits regularly for signs of infestation, beginning 6-8 weeks after bloom. Install pheromone traps to monitor and decimate the moths. Fruit-bagging about 4 to 6 weeks after bloom can be used to protect the fruits. Brush the larvae off the bark with a hard brush or a special bark scraper. In smooth-barked varieties, a cardboard band can be installed around the trunk to trap moth larvae. Remove tree debris and infested fruits as soon as possible and destroy it in distance to the orchard by deep burying or burning."
105,https://plantix.net/en/library/plant-diseases/600034/oriental-armyworm/,Oriental Armyworm,Mythimna separata,Insect,"The caterpillars feed on young seedlings or leaves. At later stages they also attack young cobs. They preferably eat leaf tips and margins and feed toward the midrib, giving the leaf a saw-like appearance. Wet, brown lines of frass can be observed near the feeding damage. Defoliation can occur when the population is high. Direct damage to cobs usually is negligible because the pest usually attacks upper plant parts only when the lower leaves have largely been consumed. After defoliating a crop, they migrate in large groups to other fields, thereby their common name. Alternative hosts such as grasses can also favor their spread.","Braconid wasp Apanteles ruficrus and tachinid flies Exorista civilis parasitize on the larvae and can successfully reduce pest population and the incidence of the disease. Spinosad has also been used effectively in baits to kill the adults. Another biological control measure are the pathogenic fungi Beauveria bassiana and Isaria fumosorosea. They colonize and kill the larvae. Always consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Pesticides should be applied only if the infestation is severe. Cypermethrin can be sprayed against the larvae, preferably later in the day. Whorl application some insecticides at 25 - 30 days after germination also effectively helps to control the armyworm populations. Poison baits containing chlorpyriphos can also be used.

Their forewings are grayish yellow and scattered with black specks. They have two small clear spots with an indistinct edge in the center. Their hindwings are blueish gray with dark veins and dark external margins. Adults are nocturnal and strongly attracted to light. Females lay pale, creamy eggs under the leaves. They survive better and produce more eggs when temperatures are above 15°C. Caterpillars are stout and usually pale greenish to brown in color. They have longitudinal stripes running along the body with the ones on the flanks being broken into black spots. They are nocturnal and thrive in well fertilized fields. Favorable conditions for an outbreak include prolonged dry periods followed by heavy rainfall.",Adjust the time of sowing to avoid peak populations. Check your plants regularly for any sign of the pest. Handpick the larvae found in plants. Use light or pheromone traps to monitor infestations. Control weeds in and around the fields. Dig trenches around infested plots to control the movements of the larvae. Flood the seedbeds to drown the larvae. Remove crop residues from the field and burn them.

Tan, diamond-shaped to elongated lesions with brownish margins appear first on lower leaves and then slowly move up to younger foliage. Lesions are of different sizes and they extend beyond the leaf veins. In susceptible plants, lesions may coalesce which results in complete blight of large parts of the leaves. Cobs can also show grayish covering and malformations at later stages of the disease. The loss of productivity due to leaf damage can lead to withered plants with broken stalks. Lodging can ensue.","Biocontrol with the competitive fungus Trichoderma atroviride SG3403 was used successfully against pathogen infection.

The fungus survives in plant residues in the soil. When the conditions are favorable, it produces spores that are distributed to new plants by wind and rain splashes. It germinates on leaves and can complete its life cycle (from infection to new spore production) within 72 hours. The development of the fungus and the infection process are favored by moist weather, leaf wetness and temperatures ranging from 22 to 30°C. The damage on leaves reduces plant productivity and can lower the yield if the infection occurs early in the season.",Plant resistant varieties if available in your area. Plant different varieties of maize to avoid monocultures. Make sure to keep field clean. Rotate with non-host crops. Plow deep to bury crop residues in the soil. Plan a fallow after the harvest.

Each white mass contains a small 4-6 mm and not yet fully developed insect of white-creamy colour. Usually plant growth is unaffected, but, if the pest has been feeding at the shoot tip, this may cause growth problems.","Biological control does not exist for this minor pest. If it is needed, remove them physically by hand. Insecticides are not needed to control froghoppers and spittlebugs. Pesticides are not effective against spittlebugs because the nymphs are protected inside the foamy substance and won't be affected by the spray. Insecticides are not needed to control froghoppers and spittlebugs. Pesticides are not effective against spittlebugs because the nymphs are protected inside the foamy substance and won't be affected by the spray.","Damage is caused by spittlebugs which suck plant juices. They usually don't cause much damage, but if their numbers grow, they can become a problem. They create the foamy substance to protect from predators. Spittlebugs have three parts to their life cycle: egg, immatute stage, adult. Each stage can last up to half a year. When the eggs hatch, the young insects feed on the plant. During their following phase, they produce the foam to protect themself and keep growing until they become adults. In order to develop, the immature stage moves around the plant feeding on different parts of the plant for 1-3 months. Adult spittlebugs usually lay eggs in plant debris or in leaves and stems. Each female spittlebug lays around 100-200 eggs. They overwinter as eggs on plants. Immature stage is usually of green colour. Before developing into adults, the colour of the body darkens and wings start to develop. Spittlebugs prefer to feed on legumes and other nitrogen-fixing plants.","To get rid of spittlebugs, you can use a strong blast of water to wash away the foam and shake the bugs off the plant. Clean up your field after the growing season ends to reduce overwintering eggs. In the spring, check for any spittlebugs on weeds and get rid of them before the bugs can spread to your crops."

Maize leaves fail to unfurl properly, and the whorl becomes tightly wrapped and twisted. Rapidly growing new leaves cannot emerge and cause the whorl to bend and twist as they force their way out. Leaves that have been trapped in the whorl will often be bright yellow when they emerge, making them very noticeable in the field. Affected leaves may wrinkle near the base and will remain that way throughout the growing season.","As with many weather-related stress effects, it is common for some hybrids to be more prone to rapid growth syndrome than others.

As infestation becomes more severe, leaves appear bronzed or silvery first and then become brittle, rip open between the leaf veins, and finally fall off. Spider mite eggs can be found on undersides of leaves. The spider mite itself is located there, nesting in a cocoon resembling webbing. Infected plants will be covered by a web spun by the spider mites. Shoot tips can become bald and as a result, side shoots start to grow. In cases of heavy damage, the quantity, as well as quality of fruits, is reduced.","In case of minor infestation, simply wash off the mites and remove the affected leaves. Use preparations based on rapeseed, basil, soybean and neem oils to spray leaves thoroughly and reduce populations of T. urticae. Also try garlic tea, nettle slurry or insecticidal soap solutions to control the population. In fields, employ host-specific biological control with predatory mites (for example Phytoseiulus persimilis) or the biological pesticide Bacillus thuringiensis. A second spray treatment application 2 to 3 days after the initial treatment is necessary. Always consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Spider mites are very difficult to control with acaricides because most populations develop resistance to different chemicals after a few years of use.

The disease typically develops late in the season and during storage. Diseased kernels with white, pinkish-colored mold are interspersed amid healthy-looking ones. The kernels may also show discoloration. They might turn tan or brown. The discoloration follows a radial pattern from the top of the kernel. If conditions are favorable for the development of the disease (warm and dry weather, presence of pests), ears may be completely colonized by the fungus and show abundant fungal growth. The entire ear appears withered and the kernel might be completely consumed. Grain yield is reduced.
